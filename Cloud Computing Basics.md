# Cloud-Computing-Basics
CLOUD COMPUTING :
Cloud computing is a way to access computing resources like servers, storage, databases, software, and more over the internet, instead of having them on your own computer or within your organization's premises.
PROPERTIES AND CHARECTERISTICS :
CHARACTERISTICS :
•	Scalability  -To handle large amount of workload.
There are two types:
Vertical      - adding/removing
Horizontal  - adding
•	Elasticity  - Automatic adding or removing resources.
•	Availability - a system remains operational and accessible to users when needed.
•	Reliability - a system to perform its intended functions consistently and without failure.
•	Manageability -  cloud resources and services can be controlled, monitored, and maintained by administrators.
•	Interoperability - different cloud systems or applications to communicate and exchange data with each other.
•	Accessibility  -  easily users can access and utilize cloud services and tools from various locations and devices.
•	Portability  -  applications and data can be moved between different cloud environments or providers.
•	Performance Optimization - cloud systems and applications to improve speed, efficiency, and resource utilization for a better user experience.

PROPERTIES :
•	Dynamic provisioning - Automatically allocates computing resources like servers and storage as needed.
•	Multi Tenant design - A single instance of software serves multiple clients with their data securely separated. 
•	Control  automation - Uses software to manage and operate cloud environments. 
•	System monitoring  - Continuously tracks the performance.
•	Billing system  -  Creates and manages invoices for products or services.
•	Uniform access  -  Enables accessing different types of data.
•	Thin client -  A simple computer that relies on a central server for most processing and data storage.
•	Parallel processing - Divides large computational tasks into smaller parts.
•	Job Scheduling -  Distributes incoming network traffic or workloads across multiple servers to optimize performance.
•	Fault tolerance -  Assigns tasks or jobs to available computing resources based on criteria like resource availability. 
•	Load balancing -  A system's ability to maintain continuous operation and avoid downtime. 
•	System Resilience  - The capacity of a system to withstand disruptions, adapt to changes, and recover quickly from failures. 
•	System security  -  Measures and practices to protect cloud applications.



BENFITS FROM CLOUD :
•	Cost Savings
•	Automatic Updates
•	Enhanced Security
•	Disaster Recovery



CLOUD COMPUTING MODELS :
•	Service models
•	Deployment models

   Service models :
1.	Infrastructure as a model(Iaas)
2.	Platform as a model(Paas)
3.	Software as a model(Saas)

1.Infrastructure as a model : This model gives you the basic building blocks of cloud infrastructure, such as virtual machines (servers), storage, and networking, accessed over the internet.
Analogy : Imagine renting an empty kitchen.
Ex : Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine.
Enabling Technique : Virtualization  

2.Platform as a model : This model provides a complete platform for developing, running, and managing applications without the complexity of managing the underlying infrastructure. 
Analogy :  Someone provides you with a ready-to-use kitchen (platform) including an oven, mixer, basic tools.
EX : AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Red Hat OpenShift.
Enabling Technique : Runtime Environment Design

3.Software as a service : This model provides ready-to-use software applications hosted and delivered over the internet.
Analogy: You order food from a restaurant (SaaS application) and eat it.
Ex : Google Workspace (Gmail, Google Docs), Salesforce, Dropbox, Zoom.
Enabling Technique : Web Service

   Deployment Models :
1.	Public Cloud
2.	Private Cloud
3.	Community Cloud
4.	Hybrid  Cloud

1.Public Cloud : Computing services delivered over the internet by a third-party provider, like AWS or Google Cloud.
2.Private Cloud : A cloud environment dedicated to a single organization, which can be located on-premises or hosted by a third party.
Ex: Banks
3.Community Cloud : A cloud infrastructure shared by several organizations with common interests, such as government agencies sharing resources for secure communication.
4.Hybrid  Cloud : An IT infrastructure that combines a company's private cloud (or on-premises setup) with public cloud services.
